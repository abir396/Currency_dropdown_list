# Currency_dropdown_list
All County Currency dropdown list in html

The code shared appears to be an HTML snippet for creating a dropdown menu specifically for selecting different currencies. This could be used in a web form where users might need to choose a currency, perhaps in the context of an online store, financial application, or any platform dealing with multiple currencies.

This code snippet creates a <select> element in HTML, containing a list of currencies. Each <option> within the <select> element represents a specific currency, with its value and display label. The value attribute holds the currency code, while the label attribute represents the name of the currency.

For instance, the first option for Indian Rupees (INR) is created as follows:

html :
<option value="INR" label="Indian rupee">INR</option>

Here:
value="INR" signifies the value that will be sent when this option is chosen in a form.
label="Indian Rupees" represents the full name of the currency for better readability and accessibility.
INR is the text that will be visible as the dropdown option.
This HTML code snippet could be integrated into a larger HTML document within the <form> tags to allow users to select a currency from the provided options.

Is there anything specific you'd like to know or do with this code? Whether it's about integrating it into a web page or customizing it, I'm here to help!

Let's enjoy coding....!!
